      <li>What is an array? A short and concise answer is expected here!</li>
      <p>An array is a data structure that stores a set value of the same elements tie to set indexes.</p>
      <li>What does it mean to "hardcode" when we talk about programming? (In English, it's called "hard
        coding", "hard-coding", or "hardcoding").</li>
      <p>By hard coding we mean that instead of assigning values to variables so we can reuse them we instead "hardcode" them in to the code directly.</p>
      <li>Explain in plain text what happens in task 3, and how we can traverse (iterate) the array when we
        (humans) don't "know" how long the array is.</li>
      <p>In part 3 a string is defined. the split method is then used to split the string into an array using a set delimiter. It then prints out the words seperatly
        and tells the word number, the word index and the word itself by a for loop. By using the .length function we can determine the length of the array. </p>
      <li>Why is it beneficial to store instances of a class in arrays, as in task 4?</li>
      <p>By storing instances of a class in an array makes it possible to use functions to handle the data in a more efficient and structured way, there are also other benefits as allowing iteration and scalability</p>
      <p>The EWeekDays object store days of the week with a value (bitwise) and name. Each day get a unique number (like, Monday = 0x01, Tuesday = 0x02, etc.). Workdays and weekends combine days using their values. So, Workdays add up Monday to Friday values, and Weekends add Saturday and Sunday.

        If we want "WorkoutDays" (Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday), we just add their values: 0x01 + 0x04 + 0x08, that makes 0x0D. So, WorkoutDays looks like this:
        
        WorkoutDays: { value: 0x0D, name: "Treningsdager" }
        
        This makes it easy to combine and check days using bitwise operations.
      </p>
      <li>
        In task 8, we will use a "callback" routine when sorting. Explain how such a "callback" routine works.
      </li>
      <p>
        A callback routine in sorting is a function passed to sort(), which defines how two elements should be compared to determine their order.

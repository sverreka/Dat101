      <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
      <p>
				You should use constants when you dont want the value to change. an example of a common constant used is pi or 3.14.
        you should use variables where you want the possibility to later change the value. Not all values can be constants.
        an example is a loop. you can not create a loop with a constant.

      <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
				Parenthese control the order of operations to be done in an expression.
			</p>
      <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
      <p>
				there simplest way to decide the amount of decimals you want in a float number is by using the toFixed() method.
			</p>
      <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
      <p>
				The simplest way to compare the values to see if they are equal is to check if the difference is within a small tolerance
			</p>
      <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
      <p>
				Comparison operators return boolean values true or false.
			</p>
      <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
      <p>
				Math.random() function generates a random float between 0 and 1. Theres plenty of situations where you would need random numbers. it can be used in videogames, it can be used to generate groups of people randomly.
			</p>
      <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
      <p>
				Modulus returns the remainder value after a division. for example 10%3 = 1. since 9/3 is 3 but we still have 1 as remainder from 10. modulus is often used to check if a number is even or uneven.

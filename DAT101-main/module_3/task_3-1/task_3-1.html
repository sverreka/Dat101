    <ol>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>When the wake-up time is not 7 the if function will firstly check if the wake-up time is 8 to see if he can take the train. If the wake-up time is not 8 either. it will go to the else printout which is that he has to take the car to school.</p>
      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behaviour of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>Above i described what would happen if the wakeup time was not exactly 7, but when the wakeup time is exactly 7 the if function will print out that he can take the bus.</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>When the wakeup time is less than 7 or greater than 8, it will go to else which is the printout that he has to take the car to school.</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p>When the number is exactly 0 in part 4 it will return with the printout "Zero". 0 is neither positive or negative, but you can use both -0 and +0 in javascript code.</p>
